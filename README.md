# 🐟
A Google Chrome extension that helps you organise bookmarks more consciously. The extension replaces the default Chrome "most visited sites" page when you open a new tab.

## How to use

- Store bookmarks in sets, enabling quick access. They can, for example, be groups of your frequently visited pages, or collections of pages you would like to visit more regularly. You will be reminded of their existence every time you open a new tab. Sets are managed using your browser's bookmark manager.

- Click on the fish icon 🐟 to visit a random bookmark from your entire bookmark collection. Stay on the page for a while and remember when and why you bookmarked it in the first place. Maybe you want to check if it is stored in the right location. Maybe you don't care about it anymore and want to remove it. If you would like to visit it more often, think about adding it to a *Link Set*.

## How to install

1. **Clone or download the repository** somewhere on your computer (unpack the zip if you downloaded the archive file). 
2. **Open the Google Chrome Extension Manager** by visiting chrome://extensions/ or selecting "Window" -> "Extensions" in the menu bar. 
3. **Enable "Developer Mode"** in the top right corner. 
4. **Click on "Load Unpacked"** and navigate to the "Linkfish" folder location, then **select the folder**. 

## How to manage

Linkfish will create a homonymous folder in your bookmark tree, which will be used for storing Link Sets. Create a folder for each Set of links you want to display on the *new tab*-page. To add a bookmark to a Set, simply add it into to the corresponding folder.

Happy browsing!
