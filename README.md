# 🔗🐟
### A Google Chrome extension that helps you organise your bookmarks more consciously.

Linkfish will be displayed every time you open a new tab, replacing the default Chrome "most visited sites" page.

- Click on the fish icon 🐟 to visit a random bookmark from your entire bookmark collection. Stay on the page for a while and remember when and why you bookmarked it in the first place. Check if it is stored in the right location. If you don't care about it anymore, remove it. If you would like to visit it more often, think about adding it to a *link set*.

- Store links in *link sets* for quick access. They can, for example, be groups of your frequently visited pages, or collections of pages you would like to visit more regularly. You will be reminded of their existence every time you open a new tab. Link sets can be managed using the built-in Chrome bookmark manager.

Happy browsing!
