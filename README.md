### A Google Chrome extension that helps you organise your bookmarks more consciously.

Linkfish replaces the default Chrome "most visited sites" page when you open a new tab.

### How to use

- Click on the fish icon 🐟 to visit a random bookmark from your entire bookmark collection. Stay on the page for a while and remember when and why you bookmarked it in the first place. Maybe you want to check if it is stored in the right location. Maybe don't care about it anymore—remove it. If you would like to visit it more often, think about adding it to a *Link Set*.

- Store links in *Link Sets* for quick access. They can, for example, be groups of your frequently visited pages, or collections of pages you would like to visit more regularly. You will be reminded of their existence every time you open a new tab. Link Sets can be managed using the built-in Chrome bookmark manager.

### How to manage

On install, Linkfish will check if there is already a folder named 'Linkfish' somewhere in your bookmark tree. If not, it will automatically create it. The 'Linkfish' folder is your base for organisation of Link Sets. Inside this main folder, create a folder for each Link Set you want to display on the *new tab*-page and name it accordingly. To add a bookmark to a Link Set, simply add it into to the corresponding folder.

If you create a folder inside a Link Set folder, it will be displayed as a separate Link Set on the Linkfish page.

Happy browsing!
